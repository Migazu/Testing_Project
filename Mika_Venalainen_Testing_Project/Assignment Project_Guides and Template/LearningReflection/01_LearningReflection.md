# Learning Reflection

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Testing the Webapp was both challenging and educational. I had no prior experience with writing test cases, but this project helped me understand the structure and process. It felt satisfying to plan and document both positive and negative scenarios.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I followed the example files provided by the instructor. I started by defining the settings and variables for each test case. Then, I wrote the test cases step-by-step, including the actions, test data, and expected results.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management?
- Since I am new to testing, I don't have much experience with other tools, but I think using a visual tool like a spreadsheet or specialized software like JIRA or TestRail could make managing test cases easier.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code, which was easy to use and helped me keep the files well-organized.

## 5. Did you find any trouble? How did you solve the trouble?
- Yes, I had difficulty understanding the expected structure of the test cases and bug reports. I solved this by carefully reviewing the provided examples and comparing my work to them.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? Have you used Github before? Where?
- I hadnâ€™t used GitHub much before, so it was confusing at first. Watching a tutorial helped me understand how to create repositories and upload files.

## 7. If in the future you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? And describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other)?
- I would consider using **Selenium** because it is widely used and has good resources for learning. It also integrates well with Python, which I find relatively beginner-friendly.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` or `Automation Tester` on Glassdoor, LinkedIn, or any job search website. List the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing.
- Based on recent job postings, the most in-demand skills for software testers include:
  1. Manual testing experience.
  2. Automation testing tools like Selenium and Robot Framework.
  3. Basic programming knowledge (e.g., Python, Java).
  4. API testing knowledge using tools like Postman.
  5. Familiarity with Agile and Scrum methodologies.
  6. Strong communication skills and attention to detail.

## 9. If you are going to continue with a career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- **Technical Skills:** I need to improve my understanding of test automation tools like Selenium and gain programming skills in Python or Java.
- **Soft Skills:** I need to focus on developing better problem-solving skills and communicating my findings effectively.

## 10. Write a short Learning Reflection and Free words. Do you think that this project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (Is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module? For example, regarding the quality of content and your learning or improvement ideas?)
- This project was my first real attempt at writing structured test cases and bug reports, and it gave me a better understanding of the testing process. It was helpful to see how theoretical concepts, like positive and negative testing, can be applied in practice. While I initially struggled with the format and tools, I feel more confident now.
